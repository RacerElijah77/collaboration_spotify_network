# collaboration_spotify_network
This is our submission for HackTCNJ 2022. This web application aims to provide users with an informative and intuitive way to visualize collaboration between artists on Spotify.

## Inspiration
We all love to listen to music during our free time, and all of us use Spotify as our platform for doing so. This project allows us to work with this app's interface, and enhance the experience of other listeners.

## What it does
First, we ask the user to enter (copy in) the Spotify URL of the artist they want to search up, and after clicking the "SEND URL" button on the screen, this will show all of the Collaborations the artist worked on
throughout their discography.

## How we built it
We primarily used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Node.js to create the website, however, most of the backend has not been integrated into the front end (HTML and CSS) yet.

## Challenges we ran into
Most of our problems were from the asynchronous nature of Javascript, as well as the difficulties that come with integrating back end into front end. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to implement the core functionality of the project, that is, given a particular artist, we generate a list of artists with whom they have collaborated. Further, we developed a front end interface to our desire.

## What we learned
We gained experience working with Node.js, as well as experience with full-stack development as a whole.

## What's next for Demo Spotify Collaborated Artists
We hope to improve the link between back end and front end, so to create a full functional, and reliable web project.
